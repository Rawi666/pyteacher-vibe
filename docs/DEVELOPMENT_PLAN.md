## Implementation Guidelines

### Requirements Compliance

This development plan addresses all specific requirements from the specification:

#### Core Navigation Requirements
- **Main Menu**: Two buttons for "Strict Dictionary Drill" and "Strict Dictionary Test"
- **ESC Key Behavior**: Always returns to main menu from drill/test windows
- **Close Button**: Results window closes both results and drill/test windows, returning to main menu

#### Drill Mode (LEARN) Requirements
- **Question Flow**: Incorrect answers trigger immediate move to next question, with incorrect questions kept in rotation
- **Focus Management**: Answer input always maintains focus, allowing immediate typing
- **Enter Key**: Always submits the answer without requiring additional clicks
- **Counters**: Total, Learned (correct answers), Left (remaining questions)
- **File Display**: Shows the name of the loaded JSON file

#### Test Mode (TEST) Requirements
- **Single Pass**: Each question asked exactly once
- **Counter Difference**: "Answered" instead of "Learned"
- **Same Interface**: Identical UI layout to drill mode

#### Visual Feedback Requirements
- **Correct Answers**: Green highlighting with brief display
- **Incorrect Answers**: Red highlighting with correct answer shown briefly
- **Timing**: Appropriate delays for user to process feedback before continuing

#### Technical Requirements
- **JSON Loading**: Robust handling of sample-input.json format files
- **Random Order**: Questions presented in random sequence
- **Answer Processing**: Case-insensitive comparison with whitespace normalization

#### UI Look and Feel Requirements
- **Consistent Dark Theme**: Application must always display with modern dark mode colors
- **OS Theme Independence**: Appearance must be consistent regardless of OS theme (light/dark)
- **Modern Styling**: Use contemporary dark UI design patterns and appropriate contrast ratios
- **Component Consistency**: All windows and UI components must follow the same dark theme

### PySide6 Best Practices

- Implement proper resource management (close windows, cleanup)
- Follow Qt naming conventions for UI elements
- Use Qt's layout managers for responsive design
- Implement proper exception handling in slot methods
- Ensure proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- Handle window lifecycle events correctly

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write comprehensive docstrings following PEP 257
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring
- Implement consistent answer validation and normalization
- Ensure thread-safe operations where applicable

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic classes
- GUI tests using pytest-qt for user interactions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Test with various JSON file formats and edge cases
- Test keyboard shortcuts and navigation flows
- Test window management and cleanup scenarios
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms
